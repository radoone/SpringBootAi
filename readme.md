# AI-Powered Spring Boot Workshop

Welcome to this interactive workshop on leveraging cutting-edge AI tools in software development! This repository contains a Spring Boot application that demonstrates how artificial intelligence can simplify programming and tackle real-world IT challenges.

## About the Workshop

During this hands-on session, you'll witness live coding demonstrations using state-of-the-art AI tools. Our experienced lecturer will guide you through practical examples that showcase how AI can revolutionise your development workflow and inspire your future career in technology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 23 or higher
- Gradle 8.x
- cursor.ai
- A sense of humour and curiosity about AI

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/springbootai.git
   cd springbootai
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Configuration

The application uses Spring AI with OpenAI integration. You'll need to configure your API keys in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.ai.openai.api-key=your-api-key-here
```

## Workshop TODOs

During the workshop, we'll be enhancing this application with the following features:

### 1. DeepSeek API Integration

We'll implement integration with the DeepSeek AI API to demonstrate alternative AI models and compare their capabilities with OpenAI.

### 2. Web Frontend

We'll add an HTML/web frontend to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with our AI-powered application. This will showcase how to build a complete full-stack AI solution.

### 3. Database Integration

We'll incorporate a database to store conversation history and user preferences, demonstrating how AI applications can maintain context and improve over time.

## Why This Matters

AI isn't just a buzzwordâ€”it's transforming how we approach software development. By the end of this workshop, you'll have practical experience with AI tools that can:

- Accelerate your coding workflow
- Solve complex problems more efficiently
- Generate creative solutions you might not have considered

Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, these skills will be invaluable in your future tech career.

## A Note to Students

This workshop is designed to be both educational and entertaining. We believe learning works best when it's enjoyable! While we'll maintain professional standards, expect a few laughs along the way as we explore the occasionally unpredictable world of AI.

Remember: The robots are here to help us, not replace us... at least for now! ðŸ˜‰
